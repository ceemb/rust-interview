# Interview Structure
You have 30 minutes to get to know Rust. No need to hurry to finish as many assignments as possible or to finish one assignment completely before moving on to the next (if you get stuck on something you really can't solve).

The focus is on getting to know the Rust language and trying to solve errors using the available documentation, not to solve the assignments.

Try to solve the assignemnts yourself (with the compiler errors and documentation) before looking at the proposed solutions.


# Running the Code
To test whether your solution for an assignment works, simply run `cargo run --bin assignment1` (for assignment 1).
